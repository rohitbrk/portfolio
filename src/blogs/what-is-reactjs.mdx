      <b>ReactJs</b>
    </h1>
    As the official ReactJs docs say, ReactJs is nothing but ..

      A JavaScript Library for building User Interfaces
    </h4>
  </div>
  <p>We will look at things one by one that ReactJs offers to better understand why it is the most loved library for web.</p>
  <div>
  <h3>Component</h3>
    <p>
React uses Component Based architecture. The whole UI can be de-composed into small, re-usable components.
  </p>
    <h4 style={{textAlign:"center", boxShadow: "0 8px 16px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.2)", marginLeft:"2rem", marginRight:"2rem", width:"74%", borderRadius:"0.4rem"}}>
      A component is an independent, reusable code block.
    </h4>

  style={{ width: "32rem", borderRadius: "0.4rem" }}
/>
<p>
As you can see in the image, the UI is divided into multiple small, re-usable components.
</p>
<p>The <code>ProductRow</code> component is rendered differently by passing data via props. Okay, but what are Props? Don't worry.. we will get to it.</p>
<p>The <code>FilterableProductTable</code> is the Parent component of two Child components <code>SearchBar</code> and <code>ProductTable</code>.</p>
<p>Data (state) can be shared between components. Parent to Child (via props), Child to Parent. (pass function prop. Child calls that using data)</p>
</div>
<div>
  <h3>Props and State</h3>
  <h4 style={{textAlign:"center", boxShadow: "0 8px 16px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.2)", marginLeft:"2rem", marginRight:"2rem", width:"74%", borderRadius:"0.4rem"}}>
      Props (Properties) is data which is passed from Parent to Child. State is maintained by the component itself. Component re-renders if State or Props changes.
    </h4>
  <img
  src="/reactjs-state-props.png"
  alt="reactjs-state-props"
  style={{ width: "32rem", borderRadius: "0.4rem" }}
/>
<p>Okay. That's lot. Lets understand. (<code>useState</code> - more on this later)</p>
<p>Greet is Functional component (ReactJs has Class components too). HTML-like markup inside a JavaScript function is JSX. (syntax extension for JavaScript)</p>
<p>It receives <code>name</code> as prop from it's Parent and renders it.</p>
<p><code>count</code> is state, which is maintained in the component itself. <code>setCount</code> function is used to manipulate <code>count</code>.</p>
</div>

<div>
  <h3>Hooks</h3>
  <h4
    style={{
      textAlign: "center",
      boxShadow: "0 8px 16px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.2)",
      marginLeft: "2rem",
      marginRight: "2rem",
      width: "74%",
      borderRadius: "0.4rem",
    }}

    Hooks let you use different React features from your components.
  </h4>
  <img
    src="/reactjs-hooks.png"
    alt="reactjs-hooks"
    style={{ width: "32rem", borderRadius: "0.4rem" }}
  />
  <p>Few important hooks include..</p>
  <p>
    <code>useState</code> - State lets a component remember information.
    (string, number, object etc) <code>useState</code> takes initial state value
    as argument. <code>isOnline</code> is the state. <code>setIsOnline</code>{" "}
    lets you manipulate it.
  </p>
  <p>
    <code>useRef</code> - Hook that lets you reference a value thatâ€™s not needed
    for rendering. (timeoutId)
  </p>
  <p>
    <code>useEffect</code> - Effects let to perform actions like fetching, state
    manipultion etc based on the dependencies you provide.
  </p>
  <p>
    <code>useContext</code> - Lets you read and subscribe to context(state) from
    your Component.
  </p>
  <p>
    <code>useFetch</code> - We can build our own custom hooks like this one.
    This hook lets you make fetch calls with ease by customization.
  </p>
